## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: Usually comes with Node.js, or install Yarn globally: `npm install -g yarn`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

## Future Enhancements: Backend Integration

LyricSearch Pro is designed with future scalability in mind. While the current version leverages a public third-party API (`https://api.lyrics.ovh`), the next major phase of development will focus on integrating a custom backend. This will allow for greater control over data, enhanced features, improved rate limit management, and a more robust and secure application architecture.

### Planned Features with Backend Integration:

  * **Custom Lyric Database:** Storing and serving lyrics from our own managed database, reducing reliance on external APIs.
  * **User Accounts & Personalization:**
      * **Favorite Lyrics:** Users can save their favorite lyrics for quick access.
      * **Search History:** Track recent searches for convenience.
      * **User Contributions:** Potentially allow users to submit or correct lyrics (with moderation).
  * **Advanced Search & Filtering:** More sophisticated search capabilities beyond simple artist/song names.
  * **Performance Optimization:** Implement caching strategies and optimized data retrieval.
  * **Enhanced Security:** Secure API endpoints, user authentication, and data protection.

### Technology Stack for Backend:

The backend will be developed using modern, scalable technologies to ensure high performance and maintainability.

  * **Language:** JavaScript/TypeScript
  * **Framework:** **Node.js** with **Express.js** (for RESTful API development)
  * **Database:**
      * **MongoDB** (NoSQL, for flexible data modeling and rapid development)
      * *Alternative/Future Consideration:* **PostgreSQL** (SQL, for structured data and strong data integrity)
  * **Authentication:** **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication.
  * **Deployment:** Cloud platforms like **Vercel** (for serverless functions) or **Render/Railway** (for full-stack deployment).
